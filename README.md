# Contour Graph Network for Image Instance Segmentation

## Overview

This project implements a novel approach to instance segmentation using Contour Graph Networks. It provides an efficient and accurate solution for segmenting individual objects in images by leveraging contour information and graph-based processing.

## Features

- **Contour-based Processing**: Utilizes object contours for precise instance segmentation
- **Graph Neural Network**: Implements graph-based neural networks for feature learning
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on instance segmentation tasks
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for real-time applications
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integration with existing computer vision pipelines

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- pip package manager

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DoMaiVietHoang/Contour-Graph-for-Image-instance-segmentation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Contour-Graph-for-Image-instance-segmentation

# Install dependencies

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from contour_graph import ContourGraphSegmentation

# Initialize the model
model = ContourGraphSegmentation()

# Load and process an image
image = load_image("path/to/image.jpg")
segments = model.predict(image)

# Visualize results
visualize_segments(image, segments)
```
